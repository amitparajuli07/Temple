                The Venkateswara Temple of Tirumala or Sri Venkateswara Swami
                Temple is a Hindu temple situated in the hills of Tirumala,
                Tirupati Urban Mandal in the Tirupati district of Andhra
                Pradesh, India. The temple is dedicated to Venkateswara, a form
                of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared on earth to save
                mankind from trials and troubles of Kali Yuga. Hence the place
                is also known by the name Kaliyuga Vaikuntha and the deity here
                is referred to as Kaliyuga Prathyaksha Daivam. The temple is
                also known by other names like Tirumala Temple, Tirupati Temple
                and Tirupati Balaji Temple. Venkateswara is also known by other
                names including Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa.[4] The temple is
                run by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which is under
                control of Andhra Pradesh Government. The head of TTD is
                appointed by Andhra Pradesh Government.

                Tirumala hills are part of Seshachalam Hills range. The hills
                are 853 metres (2,799 ft) above sea level and comprise seven
                peaks, representing the seven heads of Adisesha. The temple lies
                on the seventh peak—Venkatadri, on the southern banks of Sri
                Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank. Hence the temple is also
                referred to as "Temple of Seven Hills".[5] Tirumala town covers
                an area of about 10.33 sq mi (26.75 km2).

                The temple of Venkateswara was built by Thondaman king and
                reformed periodically by Cholas, Pandyas and Vijayanagar. The
                temple is constructed in South Indian architecture and is
                believed to be constructed over a period of time starting from
                300 CE.[6] The Garbhagruha (Sanctum Sanctorum) is called Ananda
                Nilayam. The presiding deity, Venkateswara, is in standing
                posture and faces east in Garbha Gruha. The temple follows
                Vaikhanasa Agama tradition of worship. The temple is one of the
                eight Vishnu Swayambhu (self-manifested) Kshetras and is listed
                as the 75th Divya Desam, one of the 108 temples mentioned in the
                Naalayira Divya Prabandham. The Temple premises have two modern
                Queue complex buildings to manage the pilgrim crowd, Tarigonda
                Vengamamba Annaprasadam complex for free meals to Pilgrims, hair
                tonsure buildings and a number of pilgrim lodging sites. The
                temple is one of the richest in the world in terms of donations
                received and wealth
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                There are several legends associated with the manifestation of
                the deity in Tirumala. According to one legend, the temple has a
                murti of Venkateswara, it is believed, which shall remain there
                for the entire duration of the present Kali Yuga
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                As of 2025, it is one of the richest temples in world with a net
                worth of over ₹3 lakh crore (US$35 billion).[13] The total
                assets of the Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala, Tirupati, are
                estimated to be over ₹2.5 lakh crore (US$29 billion) in
                2022.[14][15] This includes land parcels, buildings, cash and
                gold deposits in banks, given as offerings to the temple by
                devotees. As of 30 September 2022, the Tirumala Tirupati
                Devasthanams (TTD), the governing body of the temple, had fixed
                deposits with several PSU and private banks amounting to over Rs
                15,938 crore.[14][15] The gold deposits made by the Devasthanams
                in banks have also now increased rapidly from 7.3 tonnes in 2019
                to 10.25 tonnes.[14][15] The temple is one of the world's most
                visited religious sites, attracts around 24 million devotees
                annually.[16] The average daily pilgrim footfall is above 60,000
                devotees, and the number crosses one lakh devotees during the
                annual Brahmotsavams, Vaikunta Ekadasi, and other festival and
                holiday seasons

                During Dvapara Yuga, Adishesha resided on earth as Seshachalam
                Hills after losing a contest with Vayu. According to Puranas,
                Tirumala is regarded as Adivaraha Kshetra. After killing
                Hiranyaksha, Adivaraha resided on this hill. Venkatachala
                Mahatyam is the widely accepted legend over Tirumala Temple
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                During Kali Yuga, Narada advised some sages who were performing
                yagna to decide who could be given the fruits of yagna among
                Trimurtis (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva). Bhrigu was sent to test
                the Trinity. The sage who had an extra eye in the sole of his
                foot visited Brahma and Shiva and went unnoticed in both these
                locations. He cursed Brahma to be not worshipped and Shiva to be
                worshipped as a lingam. At last he visited Vishnu and the lord
                acts as if he had not noticed Bhrigu. Getting angered by this
                act, sage Bhrigu kicked Vishnu in the chest, to which Vishnu did
                not react and instead apologised to the Sage by massaging his
                feet. During this act, he squashed the extra eye that was
                present in the sole of Bhrigu's foot. However Lakshmi finds it
                as an insult since Vishnu's chest was considered as Lakshmi's
                residence (vakshasthala) and Bhrigu kicked it which indirectly
                insulted Lakshmi. She then left Vaikuntha and came to Earth to
                Kolhapur and started meditating
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Vishnu bore human form as Srinivasa, left Vaikuntha, in search
                of Lakshmi, reached the Seshachalam hills in Tirumala and
                started meditating. Lakshmi learned of the condition of
                Srinivasa and called Shiva and Brahma. Shiva and Brahma then
                converted themselves into Cow and Calf and Lakshmi had handed
                over the cow and calf to Chola king ruling over Tirumala Hills
                at that time. The Cow would provide milk to Srinivasa daily
                while it was taken for grazing. One day, a cowherd saw this and
                tried to beat the Cow with his staff but Srinivasa had borne the
                injury. Getting angered by this Srinivasa had cursed the Chola
                king to become a Demon as dharma says sins committed by servants
                (shudras) should be borne by Kings. The king prayed for mercy
                after which Srinivasa said to him, that the King should take
                next birth as Akasharaja and should perform marriage of his
                daughter Padmavati with Srinivasa
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Srinivasa went to his foster-mother Vakula Devi on Tirumala
                hills and stayed there for a while. After curse, Chola king took
                rebirth as Akasharaja and he had a daughter named Padmavati, who
                was born in the Padmapushkarini situated at present day
                Tiruchanur in Andhra Pradesh. Srinivasa married Padmavati who is
                form of Lakshmi at present day Narayanavanam in Andhra Pradesh
                and returned to Tirumala Hills. The Lord's desire to be on the
                seven hills for the emancipation of mankind from the perpetual
                troubles of Kali Yuga. Both the Lord and Goddesses turn into
                stone deities expressing their wish to be always there.
